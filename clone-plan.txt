# 🧠 KUMAR-CLONE

A long-term personal AI project to build a digital "clone" that talks, thinks, and behaves like you — powered by GPT-4 Turbo, open-source tools, and a bit of personality magic.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal
To create a custom AI agent that mimics your personality, voice, and knowledge — enabling realistic conversations that reflect how you talk, think, and interact.

---

## 🧱 Features
- 🧠 GPT-4 Turbo backend for consistent, high-quality language
- 📦 Memory system to recall personal facts, quirks, and knowledge
- 🗣 Voice interaction via Whisper (STT) and Bark or ElevenLabs (TTS)
- 💾 Local + cloud-ready vector memory with ChromaDB or FAISS
- 🌐 Simple frontend using Streamlit or Gradio

## 🛠 Tools & Tech
- GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI API)
- Python (requests, dotenv, Streamlit, etc.)
- Whisper (speech-to-text)
- Bark or ElevenLabs (text-to-speech)
- ChromaDB or FAISS (memory store)

---

## 🧪 MVP Plan (Minimum Viable Clone)
1. ✅ Basic chat interface using GPT-4 + your persona prompt
2. ✅ Load memory facts dynamically from your personal data
3. ✅ Log conversations to track improvement
4. ✅ Add voice input/output
5. 🔁 Ongoing: expand memory, improve tone matching, train local clone (optional)

---

## 📈 Future Goals
- Fine-tune small LLMs on your own data
- Deploy 24/7 hosted clone (cloud or PC)
- Add emotional memory and daily learning loop
- Agent mode: make it act as you in tasks or responses

---

## 📌 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Basic familiarity with APIs and Python scripting

---

## 🙋‍♂️ Who’s This For?
- Developers looking to build a personal AI sidekick
- Students interested in NLP + AI agents
- Anyone curious to see if a machine can act like them

---

## 👋 Get Involved
